## The Zen of Python

### Viewing the Zen

```python
import this

# Prints:
# The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
#
# Beautiful is better than ugly.
# Explicit is better than implicit.
# Simple is better than complex.
# Complex is better than complicated.
# Readability counts.
# ...
```

The Zen offers guidance for Pythonic code:

- Use simple, clear approaches
- Readability matters
- Practicality beats purity
- Errors should never pass silently
- Flat is better than nested
- Sparse is better than dense
